# Challenge3

In this challenge, I used arrays in order to generate random passwords based on user choices. 

First, I created a list of arrays including uppercase letters, lowercase letters, numbers, and special characters. 

Then, I created a function to determine the desired length of the password. 

Next, I created a function that will take in the user's choices for their desired password. 

Finally, I created a function for the actual generating of the password using loops to select characters inside the arrays I created that are referenced in line 5 of the readMe.
